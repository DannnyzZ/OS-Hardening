# OS Hardening

This repository contains an extensive list of OS hardening practices for most popular platforms used worldwide.

Operating system (OS) hardening is the process of securing an operating system by reducing its attack surface, minimizing vulnerabilities, and limiting the ability of attackers to exploit the system. The goal of OS hardening is to improve the overall security of the system by removing unnecessary software and services, applying security updates and patches, and configuring the system settings to minimize security risks. By hardening the OS, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
